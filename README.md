## How to Use

> NOTE: Data must include a header row

### Option 1: Paste TSV (tab separated values)

Copy data from spreadsheet
![spreadsheet data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jess-olivo/config-editor/main/screenshots/tsv-copy.png)

Paste it in the text area and click "Parse Data"
![tsv data pasted into textarea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jess-olivo/config-editor/main/screenshots/tsv-paste.png)

### Option 2: Upload CSV (comma separated values)

Click "Choose File" and select your .csv. The data will be automatically parsed when you confirm.

### Grouping by Key (header)

Select the radio input next to your desired sort option. You can leave it as "None" (default) or select one of the keys. The Resulting JSON will update to show the newly sorted data

### Edit Keys

You can rename your keys by typing the new name in the input box and clicking "Confirm".
Clicking the "X" will instantly delete the key/value pair from all rows.

You can add a new key to each row by entering the name and clicking "Add key". This will add the key with a value of `null` to each row. The values can be edited in "Edit Rows".

The resulting JSON will update to show the updated data

> üêû Bug: There is an issue where if you change the grouping from "none" and then edit a key, the resulting JSON does not update. A workaround is to then change the grouping to any other option and it will update. You can then change the grouping back.

> üêû Bug: If you group by a key and then delete that key it is not reverting the resulting JSON back to showing the original data without any grouping.

### Edit Rows

This is all of the data. Here you can click "Edit" and change a row's value. You have the option to update the single row or all rows at once.
You can also delete the key/value pairs. **This will delete the key/value for all rows**

### Resulting JSON

An output of the parsed data.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jess-olivo/config-editor.git
